This project was made by Suzuki Montaro - https://github.com/realparadise

## Technologies:
- [Next.js (Typescript, Pages router)](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
- TailwindCSS
- next-themes
- OpenAI's `Assistant API` speaking with a custom Assistant that I made.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) within your browser to see the result.

## Core Changes to Make it Your Own

1. I have housed most of the unique content within `{componentName}Data.ts` files. You will see them within each component folder. Update them with your own content.
2. You can change themes globally within the `tailwind.config.js` file.
3. Vanta.js animated backgrounds can be finnicky, so be on your toes with source control as you work with them.

### Please note: If you do not want to use the chatbot, you need to remove/comment-out the `ChatbotFixedButton`, `ChatbotNavbarButton`, and `ChatbotModal` usages/imports in components/Navbar.tsx

#### (Optional) Chat-bot Setup
1. Have a premium OpenAI account with API access (I believe you have to request it, circa 2023).
2. Create a new OpenAI project.
3. Create a new API key.
4. Create a new .env.local file in the root directory of your cloned project.
5. In this .env.local file, add the following line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
6. Update the contents of `content/structuredData.json`. This file is what the OpenAI Assistance references during chatbot conversations. If you had much more content you will quickly feel slower responses. It is not scale well with larger data, as-is.

### Want to deploy? I suggest using Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
- #### Vercel was great for me because it was quick and easy to configure and deploy. It's lightweight with deeper features for analytics and optimization. Auto-redeployment upon changes to `main` branch is also very nice.
- ### Important deployment note - Do not forget you need to set your OpenAI API Key as an environment variable in the Vercel website if you want the Chatbot to work in production.
- "The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js."
